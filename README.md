## Overview
Hi! I'm Martin Rock, an aspiring Full-stack Web developer. I have a 1 year experience of knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS when I was in my secondary school. I'm building my very first code as of this day, relearning all the stuffs that I have learned in middle school. This is my 1st Frontend Web Dev Challenge.

## My process

The steps are quite simple: I just use HTML and CSS code as my language. I just did a simple task to create a QR Code Card by creating 2 sections that are all aligned in the center, including the text. The real challenge is how you guess the size as accurately as possible. To make it easier for me, I based my font with the paragraph's font-size since it's already given as 15px, then from there, I started to estimate the sizes for header, the QR Image, and the card (white). First section is the container of the card. The second section is the card itself, where it contains the image, the header (h3), and the paragraph, all display through "flex" value, with the direction of value "row".

I basically didn't apply the media query because the max-width condition (375px) for mobile devices are quite accurate with the code I made, and that's the case too with max-width condition for desktop (1440px).
